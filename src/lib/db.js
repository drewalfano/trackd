 * evicts a daily staple, because recency has no idea that the thing it dropped
 * is eaten every morning and the thing it promoted will never be eaten again.
 * The rail was at its least useful the day after anything out of the ordinary.
 *
 * So the front of the rail is a count over a window: everything logged at least

 * enter that tier at all, and a daily breakfast cannot leave it.
 *
 * **Ties break on recency, and that is not a detail either.** Once a rail is
 * mostly foods sitting on two or three logs, the counts stop separating them
 * and the order would otherwise be whatever the map happened to iterate — an
 * arbitrary sequence that never moves. Recency inside a tier keeps the rail
 * feeling alive without letting it be reordered by a single meal.
 *
 * **The tail is still recency, and fills to `limit`.** The frequent tier is
 * empty on a fresh install and small for weeks after, and a rail that shows two
 * tiles because it is being strict about evidence is a worse rail than the one
 * it replaced. So whatever the tier does not fill is topped up with the most
 * recently used foods, newest first, skipping anything already above — and
 * those may be older than the window, since being outside it is exactly the
 * condition. Nothing is padded: with fewer than `limit` foods ever logged, the
 * rail is simply shorter.
 *
 * Counted by `identityKey`, not by `foodId`. The same real food can exist as two
 * records — one adopted from a barcode, one typed by hand — and counting the ids
 * separately would split a food's history in half and then rank it on half its
 * evidence, which is the exact mistake this function exists to stop. The
 * surviving card is the most recently used of the pair, so it carries that
 * record's serving.

 * its own would leave that as a rule to be remembered at every call site;
 * keeping it here means there is nowhere to write it when the food does not
 * exist. It is also deleted with the food, exported with the food and imported
 * with the food, none of which needed writing.
 *
