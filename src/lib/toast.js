/**
 * THE DECK: toasts stack in depth, not in a column.
 *
 * They used to sit in a flex column, oldest on top, newest under it, and the
 * column grew upward from the tab bar by a full toast and a gap for every one on
 * screen. That is why the cap was two — three of them reached halfway up a
 * phone and buried Today's Quick add rail.
 *
 * Now every toast occupies the same grid cell, bottoms aligned, and the newest
 * is in front. The ones behind it are lifted a few pixels and drawn a little
 * narrower, so what shows of each is a strip along its top edge — enough to say
 * there is a queue, and nothing more. Three toasts cost one toast plus two
 * strips instead of three toasts and two gaps.
 *
 * Depth is a number on the element, `--depth`, and the stylesheet turns it into
 * the lift and the scale. `layout()` is the only writer; it runs after every
 * arrival and every departure, so a card behind comes forward on the same
 * transition whether the front left by a tap, a swipe, or its own timer.
 *
 * **Only the front is live.** A card behind is covered except for its strip,
 * and a swipe that started on the strip would drag a toast down behind the one
 * in front — a gesture with no legible result. Its Undo is unreachable until it
 * comes forward, which it does the moment the front is swiped away. That is the
 * cost of the deck, taken deliberately: a burst of deletes used to show every
 * Undo at once, and it also used to cover the screen.

/**
 * ONE ROW: the message, and the action if there is one.
 *
 * What this replaces was two rows and a circle — a message row, then a control
 * row holding a full-width Undo beside a 44px X. It measured **115px** with an
 * action and **84px** without, on a box that exists for five seconds over the
 * bottom of whatever you were just looking at.
 *
 * The two rows were bought for a specific reason and the reason does not survive
 * being measured. Row one was given to the message alone so a name like
 * `Grilled Chicken Breast, 180g` would have the full 295px and not wrap.
 *
 * That name does wrap here, and the wrap costs **6px**: the line box goes 21 to
 * 42, the action holds the row at 36, so the taller of the two wins and the
 * toast goes 60 to 66. The old shape spent ~50px making sure it never happened.
 * Paying fifty to avoid six is the whole of the change.
 *
 * The X is gone with it. It existed so the toast could be dismissed early, and
 * it was the app's only control drawn at 44px purely so it would not look
 * smaller than itself elsewhere — the note that used to be here admitted it
 * cost 17px on the commonest toast in the app and took that deliberately. Early
 * dismissal is now the swipe, which costs no pixels at all.
 *
 * **The one thing the X was genuinely protecting is still protected.** A toast
 * sits where a thumb rests, and the thing it covers is the thing you just
 * changed, so a stray tap is likely — and on an Undo toast a stray tap that
 * dismissed would destroy the recovery you were just offered. There is still no
 * tap-to-dismiss surface. The only tappable thing on a toast is its action, and
 * a swipe is a deliberate gesture that a resting thumb does not perform.
 *
 * The action is a 36px pill rather than a 44px full-width bar. It keeps its fill
 * so it still reads as a control, at a size proportional to a message that is
 * leaving on its own in five seconds — a full-width filled button is the shape
 * of a primary action, and Undo is an offer, not an instruction.
 *
 * Measured at 375pt: **60px with an action, 45px without, 66px when the message
 * wraps.** Against 115 and 84 before, and the old two-row shape was 115 whether
 * the message wrapped or not.
