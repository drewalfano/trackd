 * `over` rounds its operands and then differences them, rather than
 * differencing raw floats and rounding after. This is the same rule the ring's
 * centre already used, and it is here because the two marks disagreed.
 *
 * The chip took the raw difference and rounded it for display; the ring rounded
 * first. At 300.4 against a target of 300 the chip rendered `+0` — its guard
 * was on the raw 0.4, so a chip appeared to say nothing — while the ring read
 * `0g left`. One screen, one day, two answers, and neither of them `+0.4`,
 * which is the number they were actually arguing about.
 *
 * Rounding first is the reading that matches what is on screen. Both marks show
 * whole units, so the question they answer is "is the whole number I am showing
 * you past the whole number I am showing you it is against" — and that question
 * cannot be answered from operands the reader never sees. It also means `+0` is
 * now unreachable rather than guarded against: the value is a whole number, so
 * `over > 0` and `over` printing as non-zero are the same condition.
 *
 * This matters more than a stray chip. The ring's overage lap is drawn from
 * this figure, so a raw-float `over` would draw a notch on a ring whose own
