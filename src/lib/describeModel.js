/**
 * The model call, and the only file in the app that knows which model.
 *
 * Everything above this boundary speaks in `{spans, unresolved}` going in and a
 * plain array of items coming out. The endpoint, the auth header, the request
 * envelope and the response shape are all in here, so changing provider is a
 * change to this file and nothing else.
 *
 * **One call, and it happens after resolution rather than before it.** The
 * spec left this open — estimate in a second call, or estimate in the first and
 * use it only as a fallback. On the on-request design the question resolves
 * itself: the call fires only once the library, the staples table and Open Food
 * Facts have all already failed, so there is nothing left for a second round
 * trip to check. Asking for the estimate in the same call as the split costs
 * tokens that are already being spent and saves a whole extra request.
 *
 * What comes back is still treated as a fallback, never as an answer. Anything
 * the model names is put through resolution again on the way out — a dish it
 * splits out of a compound name may well exist in the library — and an estimate
 * is used only where that second pass also finds nothing. Spec 9.3 holds:
 * resolution before estimation, always.
 *
 * **What leaves the device is exactly the two lists passed in.** No date, no
 * targets, no profile, no library contents, and none of the items the rules
 * already placed. There is no logging, no proxy and no second recipient. The
 * key is read here and travels in the header of this one request.

- quantity and unit: unit is exactly "g", "ml" or "serving". Use "serving" when the amount is a portion rather than a weight, and keep whatever amount was written.
- packaged: true for a branded or packaged product, false for a homemade or restaurant dish.
- kcal, protein, fat, carbs: your best estimate of the TOTAL for that quantity, not per 100 g. Macros in grams.

Rules:
- Return only foods that appear above. Do not add dressings, sides, drinks or garnishes that were not written, however likely they are.
- A line that is one dish whose name happens to contain commas comes back as one entry, under its full name.
- Where an amount was written as a portion — "a small serving", "a few handfuls" — estimate what that portion weighs for that food and give the macros for it.
- If a line means nothing you can identify, return it as one entry with the line as the name and null for quantity and all four macros. Do not guess.`
