 * The model call, and the only file in the app that knows which model.
 *
 * Two calls share everything below the prompt. `describeMeal` reads a WHOLE
 * description and returns the foods in it, brands and modifications intact —
 * it is how the Describe sheet decides what the items are, before anything is
 * looked up. `describeLeftovers` is the older, narrower job the plate still
 * uses: finish the fragments a local read could not. Both speak in plain
 * arrays of items coming out. The endpoint, the auth header, the request
 * envelope and the response shapes are all in here, so changing provider is a
 * change to this file and nothing else.
 *
 * **Interpretation and estimation ride in one request, and are used apart.**
 * Every item the model names is put through the app's own lookup on the way
 * out — the library, the staples table, Open Food Facts — and the estimate it
 * came with is consulted only where that lookup finds nothing. Asking for the
 * estimate in the same call as the reading costs tokens that are already
 * being spent and saves a whole extra round trip; using it only as a fallback
 * is what keeps spec 9.3 true: a food that exists never takes an estimated
 * value.
 *
 * **What leaves the device is exactly the text passed in.** For `describeMeal`
 * that is the description as typed; for `describeLeftovers` it is the two
 * lists of fragments. No date, no targets, no profile, no library contents.
 * There is no logging, no proxy and no second recipient. The key is read here
 * and travels in the header of this one request.

Keep every word of a product name that was written, in the order it was written. No quantity words in the name.
- brand: the brand, chain or restaurant that was named, or null.
- quantity and unit: unit is exactly "g", "ml" or "serving". Use "serving" when the amount is a count or a portion rather than a weight, and keep whatever amount was written. Use 1 when no amount was written and the food is a single thing; null only when the amount is genuinely unknowable.
- modifiers: how it was customised — milk choice, size, syrups, "no sugar", "extra shot", "no cheese" — as short phrases, in the order written. Empty when there are none.
- packaged: true for a branded or packaged product or a chain menu item, false for a homemade or generic food.
- kcal, protein, fat, carbs: your best estimate of the TOTAL for that quantity with its modifiers, not per 100 g. Macros in grams.

Rules:
- "and", "&" and commas are often part of one product's name ("spinach & egg white bites", "mac and cheese", "salt and vinegar crisps") or join a modification to the thing it changes ("a latte with oat milk and no sugar"). Split only where the words clearly name a second food or drink.
- A modification is never its own entry. It belongs to the food or drink it changes.
- Return only foods that were written. Do not add dressings, sides, drinks or garnishes that were not written, however likely they are.
- If part of the description means nothing you can identify, return it as one entry with those words as the name and null for quantity and all four macros. Do not guess.
- If nothing in the description is a food or drink, return an empty list.`
