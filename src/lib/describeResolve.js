/**
 * Turning parsed phrases into things that can sit on a plate.
 *
 * The order is library, then the staples table, then Open Food Facts, then —
 * only if a key is stored and only when asked — an estimate. Your own foods
 * lead because they are the likely hit and cost no network. Staples sit above
 * Open Food Facts for the reason the add sheet's search already documents: OFF
 * is a database of barcoded packaged products whose text search reads
 * ingredient lists, so for a bare noun like "sourdough" its best honest answer
 * is a branded loaf rather than bread. Nearly every phrase in a described meal
 * is a bare noun.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the library. A staple or an Open Food Facts product
 * resolves to a DRAFT that rides on the plate item and is adopted at commit, so
 * a parse you look at and throw away leaves no trace — the same bargain
 * `staples.js` makes for the add sheet: "nothing enters the foods store because
 * it exists somewhere, only because someone reached for it."

/**
 * Whether an Open Food Facts product is actually the food that was described.
 *
 * Open Food Facts searches ingredient lists as well as names, and it is a
 * database of BARCODED PACKAGED PRODUCTS — so for a bare noun it returns
 * something plausible far more often than something right. Left to one shared
 * word, "dry sourdough" came back as Sourdough Fusilli and "a raspberry scone"
 * as a raspberry white chocolate scone mix. Both are pasta and flour wearing
 * the right adjective, and both would have arrived on the plate as `Matched`,
 * with real macros, reading as settled.
 *
 * **The head noun is the test.** The last meaningful word of a product name is
 * what the food IS; everything before it says what kind. If that word is not
 * somewhere in what you wrote, it is a different food however many adjectives
 * agree — fusilli is not sourdough, and a mix is not a scone. Mandarin Oranges
 * in Water passes against "a mandarins in water cup" because its head, water,
 * is right there in the phrase.
 *
 * A shared term is still required as well, so a head noun matching by accident
 * cannot carry an otherwise unrelated product.
 *
 * **The brand is excluded from both tests, and that is not a detail.** Open
 * Food Facts brands are company names full of ordinary food words, and letting
 * them in wrecks the comparison in both directions at once: "house salad"
 * matched a Lite Balsamic Vinaigrette because the brand is Ken's Steak HOUSE,
 * and "dried apricots" lost its perfectly good Dried Soft Apricots because the
 * brand, Alesto, became the last word and therefore the head. What a food IS
 * lives in its name; who sells it says nothing about whether it is the thing
 * you ate.
 *
 * This is deliberately strict, and the cost is real: a food Open Food Facts
 * genuinely has will sometimes come back as "Needs a match" instead. That is
 * the trade this feature is built on — a row that admits it does not know is
 * fixable in two taps, and a confidently wrong row is one you have to catch.
