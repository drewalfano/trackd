/**
 * The rules parser. Text in, items out — no model, no network, no database.
 *
 * This runs first on every parse, and it is the permanent fallback: everything
 * here works with the radio off and with no API key stored. What it cannot
 * place is handed on as raw text rather than guessed at.
 *
 * **It does not resolve foods and it does not produce macros.** Its whole job is
 * to turn one sentence into a list of `{quantity, unit, food}` triples, so that
 * matching against the library, the staples table and Open Food Facts has
 * something structured to match. A phrase is a phrase until something else
 * looks it up.
 *
 * The output vocabulary is the app's own — `g`, `ml`, `serving` — and nothing
 * else. "2 packs", "3 slices" and "1.5 pieces" all leave here as servings with
 * the word that was actually used kept alongside, because the app has no `pack`
 * unit and inventing one would put a fourth value into `UNITS` for the sake of
 * one screen. The original word is worth keeping so resolution can notice when
 * "2 packs" lands on a food whose serving is one biscuit.
 *
 * Normalising at this boundary rather than downstream is the same discipline
 * `off.js` applies to Open Food Facts: everything crossing in gets converted
 * once, here, and nothing past this module sees an ounce.
