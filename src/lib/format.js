 *
 * Open Food Facts is crowdsourced, so `FRUIT & NUT` sits next to `organic
 * granola bites chocolate banana` in the same list and the mismatch is louder
 * than either name. Gemini's described foods arrive lowercase for the same
 * reason from a different direction.
 *
 * **Sentence case, not title case, and the reason is the exception list.**
 * Title case has to decide whether each word is a brand, a unit or a joiner,
 * so it needs `and`, `with`, `of`, `in`, `the` and a brand dictionary it can
 * never finish — and it still mangles `fish and chips`. Sentence case makes
 * exactly one claim, that a name starts with a capital, and that claim is
 * always true. The joiner list is EMPTY because nothing is ever capitalised
 * mid-name to begin with.
 *
 * Two branches:
 *
 * 1. Any lowercase letter present means the source had a casing intention.
 *    Capitalise the first letter, change nothing else. `Kellogg's Corn Flakes`
 *    and internal capitals survive untouched.
 * 2. Nothing but capitals means shouting, and shouting carries no intention to
 *    preserve. Downcase, then branch 1.
 *
 * Branch 2 is the destructive one, so it is fenced:
 *
 * - A single token of four letters or fewer is left alone, which is what saves
 *   a food actually called `PB` or `XL` from becoming `Pb`. It also means the
 *   acronym list only has to cover acronyms buried inside longer names.
 * - A token containing a digit keeps its shape, except a trailing unit: `500G`
 *   becomes `500g`, and `2L` stays `2L` because a lowercase `l` reads as a one.
 *
 * What branch 2 cannot do is recover brand capitals: `KELLOGG'S CORN FLAKES`
 * comes out `Kellogg's corn flakes`. There is no brand dictionary here and
 * inventing capitals would be the guessing this rule exists to avoid. The
 * stored record still has the original.
 *
 * Whitespace is preserved rather than collapsed — the replace runs per token
 * so the string that comes back differs from the source only in case.
