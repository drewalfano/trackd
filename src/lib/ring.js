/**
 * A mini macro ring.
 *
 * Concentric rings were rejected for the hero because concentric arcs cannot be
 * compared to each other. Equal-diameter rings in a row keep the circular
 * language while staying comparable — the thing concentric rings are worst at.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The second lap is gone, deliberately and for now.** The ring saturates at
 * its target again: past 100% it closes and stops, and magnitude past the
 * target is carried by the number in the centre.
 *
 * Removed on request, and the honest reason is that no version of it was
 * right. A stacked lap needs the crossing marked or the strand has nothing to
 * sit proud of, and the gap cut behind its cap was tried three times — shadow,
 * hole, nothing, hole — without ever settling. The last build also had to give
 * up the growth animation for that lap to keep the cap from rendering square,
 * which is a trade worth making only for a mark that is otherwise finished.
 *
 * The cost of removing it is known and unfixed, and it is the argument the lap
 * existed to answer: **a saturated ring draws `54g over` and `exactly on
 * target` as the same closed circle.** The distinction survives in the centre
 * reading — `234 / 180g`, or `54g over` in remaining mode — and in the
 * `aria-label`, which states both readings whichever is drawn. So the fact is
 * still on screen; it is the *mark* that no longer says it.
 *
 * The bars are untouched and still show overage as a darker chip inside the
 * fill, so the two marks now disagree about how to say the same thing. That is
 * the state this is parked in, not a resting point.

 * which is the same failure the bars had at `width: 0` (v1.1.4), where a
 * zero-width fill collapsed its own stroke into a coloured tick and read as a
 * rendering fault rather than as "nothing logged".
 *
 * So: zero draws no arc at all, and anything above zero draws at least this.
 * The floor overstates very small values by roughly 4% of the target, the same
 * trade the bars made with their 24px minimum fill.

/**
 * Ring with a number in its centre and the macro name beneath.
 *
 * The centre states ONE of two readings, and which one is the card's business
 * rather than the ring's — `mode` comes down from Today, where one switch flips
 * the whole card at once. Consumed reads `115` over `/ 180g`; remaining reads
 * `65g` over `left`. Both are the same shape: the value at full size, its
 * qualifier small and muted beneath, which is what the calorie row does too.
 *
 * The `g` lands once per reading, never twice. In consumed mode that is on the
 * target, because `115 / 180g` is one measurement with one unit and `115g /
 * 180g` is the unit stuttering; in remaining there is only one number, so it
 * takes the suffix itself. Calories never take one in either mode — a bare
 * number under a label that says Calories is not ambiguous about its unit, and
 * `cal` there would be the same stutter.
 *
 * Two lines rather than one because `180 / 300` measures 68.4px in Inter at
 * 15px and the hole gives 62.2px across at that height — every three-digit pair
 * is exactly that wide, the figures being tabular.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Remaining used to be the only reading, as a negative in the centre: `-159g`.
 * Two things were wrong with it, and neither is a reason not to offer it now.
 *
 * A minus sign reads as debt or as an error even when it means "still to eat",
 * and the same sign carried opposite valences — `-32g` on protein being 32 to
 * go while `-46g` on fat is 46 of headroom, with nothing on screen to say
 * which. That is fixed by the word: `left` and `over` say which, and no sign is
 * needed.
 *
 * And the number ran the wrong way — largest on an empty morning, counting down
 * while the arc filled up, the two halves of one mark moving in opposite
 * directions all day. That is still true of remaining, and it is why consumed
 * is the default. What has changed is that it is now a reading you asked for
 * rather than one the card chose for you, and a number that disagrees with its
 * arc is a very different thing when you were the one who turned it on.
 *
 * The over state needs no special form in either mode: `320 / 300g` carries
 * magnitude past the target by itself, and remaining says `20g` over `over`.
 * No sign is added in either case — a `+` or a `-` in front of these would be
 * the third notation for one fact, on a card whose whole argument is that it
 * states each fact once.
 *
 * Both the number and the name take the TEXT shade, not the fill — a fill is
 * never used as type.
