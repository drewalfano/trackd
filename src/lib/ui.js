/**

 * `pageHeader(title)` is the plain one — Trends and Settings, which are the
 * same component and differ in the string and nothing else. There is no second
 * argument for them to differ BY, which is the point of the signature: a page
 * cannot reach in and set its own title size, its own alignment or its own
 * distance from the content under it, because none of those are parameters.
 *
 * `pageHeader(title, days)` adds the day steppers and belongs to Today alone.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Today is the template and does not move.** The plain variant used to
 * collapse to its own 32.5px line box while Today's stood 44 tall on the
 * chevrons inside it, and Settings hand-rolled a third arrangement with a
 * `pt-[10px]` of its own — so the one element on all three screens sat at three
 * different heights, and its baseline spread over 10px between tabs. Both
 * variants now hold the same 44px slot, so the baseline is 31.25 everywhere and
 * the first section heading starts at 64. The arithmetic is on `.page-header`.
 *
 * **The title is centred on both, and centring is what makes the two variants
 * agree without any spacers.** The steppers are 44 and the gaps are 10, so the
 * dated variant's title box is inset by the same amount on both sides and its
 * centre is the page's centre — which is exactly where the plain variant, with
 * nothing beside it and the full width to sit in, puts its own. The pair of
 * `w-11` spacers this used to carry existed only to fake that symmetry when one
 * chevron was missing, and with no chevrons at all they were never needed.
 *
 * **`fitText` is the dated variant's alone.** It exists for `Wed, Jan 13, 2027`
 * at 230px in a 227px gap between two chevrons — a real string, reached by
 * paging back months. `Trends` and `Settings` are two short words that fit at
 * 26 with room to spare, and a plain title that could silently render at 25.5
 * on some future longer word is a title that has stopped being 26.
 *
 * Both chevrons are always drawn on the dated variant, the forward one dimmed
 * rather than swapped for a gap. A day view showing one chevron on the left
 * with empty space opposite reads as Back, on the screen where iOS has trained
 * everyone that a lone top-left chevron means exactly that. Two chevrons
 * flanking a date read as a stepper, and the pair stays put as the date changes
 * instead of the header re-forming under the thumb.

 * One food, as two lines: what it is, then what it costs.
 *
 * **This is the log's row, generalised.** It was `entryRow`'s inner block and

 * near-copy — the add sheet's Recents at three lines and a 16px name, the
 * plate's items at three lines and a 14px one. They are the same object at
 * three moments of its life: one you might eat, one you are about to eat, one
 * you ate. Three shapes for that is two too many, and the versions drifted
 * because nothing held them together.
 *
 * So the callers keep what genuinely differs — what wraps it and what sits
 * beside it — and this holds what does not.
 *
 * **There are two slots for the qualifier, and which one a caller uses is about
 * how long the qualifier can get.**
 *
 * `detail` sits beside the name after a middot. It is for something short and
 * fixed: a logged entry's time is five characters and never grows, so it costs
 * the name almost nothing and the row stays two lines.
 *
 * `sub` takes a line of its own. It is for the serving, which is the same job —
 * telling you WHICH of this food you are looking at — but a variable-length
 * version of it: `1 × 170 g`, `2 × 450 g`, `1 × 1 biscuit (15 g)`. Put beside
 * the name it truncated the name on most rows, and all three arrangements were
 * built and looked at before this was settled. Sharing the macro line was the
 * worst of them: it fits for short numbers and wraps for long ones, so one list
 * held rows of two different heights with an orphaned middot at the wrap.
 *
 * A clipped name is recognisable from its first two-thirds and a clipped
 * `1 × 2…` is not, so wherever the two do compete the name is what yields:
 * `min-w-0 truncate` on it, `shrink-0` on everything after it.
 *
 * The 2px between lines is deliberate and not 4: they are one thing said in
 * parts, so they want to sit as a block rather than as a list. The weight change
 * from a semibold name to muted figures already separates them.

 * add tiles draw from `foodTile` and so are excluded by construction — a tile is
 * a repeat of something already reviewed, and the space is not there.
 *
 * **Filled, with the stroke off.** `icon()` gives an outline by default and adds
 * the fill on top when asked, so a filled sparkle at this size arrives as a
 * 1.75px stroke around a solid shape — at 14px that is most of the glyph, and
 * the two stars close up into blobs. `stroke: 0` leaves the fill alone.
 *
 * Muted grey rather than a colour. Protein, fat, carbs and calories each own a

 * particular is spoken for twice over, by carbs and by everything destructive.
 *
 * `shrink-0`, because the name beside it is `min-w-0 truncate` and a long name
 * must clip rather than squeeze the mark.
 *
 * **14px, and the 2px nudge is measured rather than guessed.** `items-baseline`
 * puts the svg's bottom EDGE on the baseline, and the sparkle art carries about
 * 15% empty height beneath the small star — so the box sits right and the ink
 * floats. Measured at 390pt: the name's cap height is 10.19px and the glyph's
 * ink is 10.09px, which is the size the brief asked for, sitting 1.87px clear of
 * the baseline. `relative top-[2px]` drops it back onto it, so the mark occupies
 * exactly the cap band of the word beside it — same ceiling, same floor.
 *
