/**
 * One logged entry.

 * Swiping left reveals edit and delete. The actions sit behind the row, the
 * surface tracks the finger, and the two circles grow into place as it uncovers
 * them. Only one row in the app is open at a time.
 *
 * They are full-size ink circles rather than the small tinted ones this used
 * to draw. Those were `bg-canvas` sitting on a `bg-canvas` track, so the only
 * thing marking either control was a 17px hairline glyph floating on the page
 * tint — no edge, no fill, nothing to say where one button ended and the next
 * began. A control revealed by a gesture has no label and no permanent home;
 * the shape has to do all of that work by itself, so it gets the full 44px and
 * the fill.
