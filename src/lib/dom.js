       * abandoned leaves the sheet open, and it must still be able to animate

       * that has already arrived, and a fresh animation-name plays from the
       * start — so abandoning a drag would drop the sheet to the bottom of the
       * screen and slide it up again. It has served its purpose the moment the
       * sheet is on screen; leaving it off costs nothing.
       *
       * The position has to be carried across either way, or cancelling the
       * entry would drop the sheet from wherever it had risen to straight back
       * down. `baseY` is that position, and every offset below is measured from
       * it — so a sheet caught halfway in keeps rising to `0` if the drag is
