/**
 * Today. A dashboard card, then the log.
 *
 * Calories is the summary and the macros are the breakdown that explains it,
 * so calories gets the number and the full-width bar while the macros get
 * three equal rings. Splitting the log into its own group is what lets the
 * dashboard be the thing you actually came for.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * The card states every value exactly once, and one switch changes WHICH value
 * that is: eaten, or remaining, everywhere at once.
 *
 * It used to say each one three times over. Calories read `1105`, then
 * `/ 2837`, then `-1732` at the end of the row; each ring read `115 / 180` and
 * then `65 left` underneath. Every one of those is the same fact — you have
 * eaten some of a number — and the third statement of a fact is not emphasis,
 * it is noise. The gap and the `left` line are gone.
 *
 * What makes that affordable is that the other reading stays reachable. Saying
 * it once is only economy if you can still ask for the half that is not on
 * screen, and both readings are one touch apart, neither permanently occupying
 * space to say what the other already said.
 *
 * Which one leads is not arbitrary. Eaten runs with its own arc — the number
 * grows as the ring fills — where remaining runs against it, counting down all
 * day while the mark beside it counts up. That disagreement is the reason
 * remaining is not the first-run default, and it stops being a problem the
 * moment it is the reading you asked for rather than the one you were handed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **How you get to the other reading has now been through six answers**, and
 * has arrived back where it started. The order is the useful part, because each
 * one only looked wrong once it existed:
 *
 *   1. A bare tap on the card, nothing on screen to say so — undiscoverable.
 *   2. A segmented Eaten / Remaining switch — redundant with the tap, redundant
 *      with the reading, and the reason the header band was as tall as it was.
 *   3. Two paging dots — on a card that pages horizontally with yesterday
 *      peeking in at the left, which made them read as "swipe for more cards".
 *   4. A vertical swap glyph — no longer a paging signal, still an object.
 *   5. A muted state label in the corner — the best of them, and still a fifth
 *      statement of a reading the card already gives four times.
 *   6. The bare tap again.
 *
 * Five of the six were built and looked at rather than argued about, which is
 * the only reason the sixth is a decision instead of the thing nobody got round
 * to. What is left underneath it is `modeReach`: a control with no pixels, so
 * the reading stays reachable without anything claiming space to say so.
 *
 * The discoverability problem is real and is now openly unsolved. See
 * `modeReach`.

 * vertical swap glyph, and a muted state label in the corner. The sheet that
 * killed the last of them is in NOTES-use-audit.md, U2.
 *
 * The argument that outlived all four is the card's own, from the top of this
 * file: it already states its reading in words, in four places at once —
 * `1236 over` against `4073 / 2837`, and the same inside every ring. A control
 * that names the reading is the fifth statement of a fact the card was
 * deliberately rebuilt to stop saying twice, and every version of it read as
 * one more object on a card that had just been cleared of two.
 *
 * So the tap stands alone again, and this is what is left underneath it: a
 * control with no pixels, so that the reading is still reachable by keyboard
 * and still announced to a screen reader. Removing the visible one is a design
 * decision; removing the only way in is a regression, and they are not the same
 * edit.
 *
 * **The open cost, stated rather than hidden:** nothing on the screen says the
 * card can be tapped. `.day-card-toggle` in styles.css has admitted that since
 * it was written — "a press only answers the question after you have already
 * asked it" — and it is still true and still unsolved. A first-click test is
 * what would settle whether anyone finds it, and none of the four candidates
 * was worth shipping to avoid running one.

 * most common action. `createScreen` serialises renders and DISCARDS one that
 * was superseded mid-flight — and `quickLogFood` writes twice, the entry and
 * then the food's recency, so logging emits two changes. The first build sees
 * the new id and is thrown away before it paints; the second build finds the id
 * already recorded and animates nothing. Every quick add took that path.
 *
 * The document does not have that problem. A build that is discarded never
 * touches it, so what is mounted is exactly what the user is looking at, which
 * is the only thing "was this row already there" can honestly mean.
 *
 * **Ids rather than a newest-timestamp**, because Undo restores a deleted
 * record verbatim — original id, original `createdAt` — so "newer than anything
 * we have seen" would miss the one case where a row coming back is the entire
 * point of the offer.
 *
 * **A date change animates nothing.** Every row on the day you just swiped to
 * is new by this test, and eight rows arriving at once is not an insertion, it
 * is a screen. The mounted list carries the day it was built for, so the
 * comparison is against what is on screen rather than against a second
 * remembered value that could drift from it.
 *
 * Scoped to `[data-today-log]`, which only this screen sets. The Full log sheet
 * builds `entryRow`s too, and an unscoped query would let the rows behind a
 * scrim answer for the rows in front of it.
 */
/**

 * **Logging renders Today TWICE.** `quickLogFood` writes the entry and then the

 * its animation, and a second render lands about a frame later. By then the row
 * IS painted, so the DOM check below correctly reports nothing new, rebuilds the
 * list without the class, and destroys the animation before it has run a frame.
 *
 * The document is still the right thing to ask; it just has to be asked about a
 * window rather than an instant. A row stays "arriving" for slightly longer than
 * the animation it is playing, so a re-render inside that window re-applies the
 * class instead of cancelling it. Past the window it is simply a row.
 *
 * 300 against the 200ms of `row-in`, which leaves room for the second render to
 * be a few frames late without leaving so much that an unrelated repaint could
 * fall inside it.
 *
 * The restart this causes is invisible in practice — the second mount is
 * sub-frame — but it is a restart, and if the double render is ever collapsed
 * into one emit this whole map can go with it. That would be the better fix and
 * it belongs in the write path, not here: two full IndexedDB reads and two full

 * **The card opens the amount sheet; only `+` writes to the log.** The two were

 * sheet — and the pair were compared on device before this was settled. The
 * comparison is worth recording because it did not work the way comparisons
 * usually do: the two builds are pixel-identical. Nothing on the card changes
 * between them. So this could not be decided by looking, only by arguing about
 * what each target should mean.
 *
 * What settled it is the serving. A tile logs the LAST serving you used for
 * that food, which is right far more often than a default of one would be and
 * is still wrong sometimes — you had 200g of yoghurt yesterday and want 150
 * today. With the card opening the sheet, that case costs nothing: the amount
 * is sitting in a field, prefilled, one edit from correct. With the card
 * logging outright it costs a wrong entry and a correction afterwards.
 *
 * So the big target asks and the small one commits, which inverts the usual
 * reading of a large surface being the primary action. It is the right way
 * round here because the irreversible half is the one that should be harder to
 * hit by accident while scrolling a rail with a thumb, and because the
 * shortcut is not lost — `+` is still one tap and still skips everything.
 *
 * The cost, stated plainly: a tile on this screen and a tile on the add sheet
 * now look identical and do different things on a body tap. See `favCard` in
 * sheets/addFood.js, which still logs outright.
 *
 * Logging goes through `quickLogFood`, the same call the add sheet's favourites
 * make — so the serving used, the `computed` snapshot and the recency bump that
 * reorders this very rail all happen on one path. A second logging route with
 * its own idea of any of that is how two screens start disagreeing about what
 * you ate.
 *
 * `state.date`, not today. Today's screen shows whichever day you have stepped
 * to, and a rail that quietly logged into today from a screen showing Saturday
 * would put food on the wrong day with nothing on screen to say so. The block
 * still comes from the clock, which is the same compromise the add sheet makes:
 * the hour you are logging AT is the best guess available for a day you are not
