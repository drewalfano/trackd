/**
 * Trends. Weight, then history.

 * **The tab was called Weight, which was the only tab named after a data type
 * rather than a job.** Today, Trends and Settings all name what you are doing;
 * Weight named what was stored. It was already a trends screen — a chart over
 * time — so nutrition history is the same shape of thing rather than a fourth
 * tab, and the two belong on one screen because the question people actually
 * have is whether the intake explains the outcome.
 *
 * History moved here wholesale from `screens/history.js`, which no longer
 * exists. It had been reachable only through the Log, which was the wrong place
 * for it twice over: a destination behind a modal, and a multi-day view behind a
 * single-day one.
 *
 * The chart is deliberately neutral — none of the four macros own body weight,
 * so borrowing one of their hues here would break the rule that colour means
 * macro identity. Ink for the trend, muted grey for the raw dots.

/**
 * How long a range switch takes to cross-fade — and why it is a cross-fade
 * rather than the chart morphing to its new axis.
 *
 * **This decision should not be re-litigated, so here is what it rests on.** The
 * y-scale is not a property the chart carries; it is `axisBounds(values, unit)`
 * baked into every coordinate at construction — `y1`/`y2` on each gridline, `y`
 * on each label, and the whole `d` string on the trend path. SVG geometry
 * attributes are not animatable properties, so there is nothing to transition
 * even in principle. `d` alone can interpolate, and only between paths whose
 * segment structure matches.
 *
 * It does not match, and that is the deeper reason. A range switch changes
 * `windowPoints(allPoints, range)`, so thirty days and ninety days hold a
 * different NUMBER of points. It is not one line rescaled onto a new axis; it is
 * a different line. Morphing between them would have to invent intermediate
 * shapes that were never anybody's weight, which is a chart asserting data it
 * does not have — the same standard the honesty rules hold the rest of this
 * screen to.
 *
 * So the fade says the true thing: same instrument, different window. A morph
 * would say the line moved, and it did not.
 *
 * 180ms rather than the 160 the note that asked for this proposed, because the
 * `± / week` line changes in the same breath and takes `.reading-swap`'s 180.
 * One event, one clock — the mistake this pass has been unpicking everywhere

 * width × 150/340, so a fixed number would only be right at one screen width.
 * The two boxes are therefore the same box at every width, which is what lets
 * the cross-fade swap one for the other without the card changing height. It

 * either. The card went quiet in three places at once and explained itself in
 * none of them. It reads off the window now, in the same breath as the chart
 * and the rate, because it is the sentence those two absences share.
 *
 * Two forms, and the pivot between them is whether the count in view is the
 * count you have. `5 more to go` is a true and useful thing to tell someone
 * starting out; told to someone with forty readings and a gap it is nonsense,
 * because they are not short of weigh-ins, they are short of recent ones.
 *
