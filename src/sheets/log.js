/**
 * The Log day view, as a sheet over Today.
 *
 * It was a routed screen, and the reason it stopped being one is that it had
 * three navigation models running at once and none of them left. A back chevron
 * that did not go back — it stepped the day — a tab bar saying this was a
 * top-level destination, and a History pill saying it was a browser. Three
 * controls that changed the date and nothing at all that closed it. The only way
 * out was the tab bar, which is a way of leaving the whole tab rather than this.
 *
 * A sheet answers that structurally instead of by relabelling: the scrim leaves
 * Today visibly behind it, so "this is temporary" needs no word to say it, and
 * the exit is the thing every other sheet in the app already has. What is left
 * in the header is one date control and one close button.
 *
 * This is the only surface where the time blocks are visible, which is still
 * correct: blocks are how you review a day, not how you log one.

/**
 * The day's four totals, on one pinned line: `1945 cal · 63 P · 94 F · 212 C`.
 *
 * **This replaced a summary card and is deliberately less than one.** What was
 * here was four `consumed / target` rows with thin bars and a `+14` overshoot
 * chip, in a `.panel` about 214px tall at the top of a height-capped sheet —
 * which is what pushed the third period below the fold. It was also the third
 * reading of the same four numbers: they are the largest element on Today, one
 * layer up and still visible above this sheet, and every row below is a share
 * of them.
 *
 * So this states them and does not measure them. No bar, no ring, no chip, no
 * progress of any kind — and no over-target mark either, because Today's rings
 * already carry that in the interior fill and the word "over", and any mark
 * here re-imports the language the card was removed for. If a total is over,
 * the surface that says so is one tap away and larger.
 *
 * **It is `macroLine`, at 15 instead of 12, and nothing else.** This was briefly
 * a hand-rolled version with its own unit map and its own spelling of the
 * spacing — `63P` closed up, `cal` spaced — and that is precisely the drift
 * `foodRowBody`'s own note describes: a component gets copied instead of
 * called, then the copy and the original disagree about a detail, and nothing
 * holds them together. There is no argument for this line reading differently
 * from the four identical lines eight pixels below it, because they are the
 * same statement about the same four numbers at two scales.
 *
 * So the convention comes with the component: the figure stays in ink so the
 * data is readable, the unit after it carries the hue, and colour means macro
 * identity here exactly as it does everywhere else.

       * the same mistake with a different name. Sticky gets the same result and
       * leaves the chrome saying what every other sheet's says.
       *
       * The construction is `labelPhoto`'s, which already does this inside a

       * hard against a 20px heading reads as that heading's divider rather than
       * as this line's edge. The clip is legible without one anyway: a card is
       * `--color-surface` on canvas, so its own top edge is the mark going.

       * `bg-canvas` is the sheet's own fill: `--color-sheet` resolves to it.
