/**
 * Every weigh-in, and the editor for one of them.
 *
 * The Weight tab's own field is deliberately today-only — weighing yourself is a
 * morning habit and the field should be one tap from the tab, not a form. This
 * is where the rest of the record lives.
 *
 * **It used to be a single-day form, and that was the wrong shape.** It opened on
 * today by default, which made it an exact duplicate of the `Remove` chip that
 * sat above it: both edited or deleted today's reading, one of them from a
 * heading row, for the least common action in the group. And a screen whose
 * whole subject is a line through sixty readings offered no way to see those
 * readings — only a date picker to guess at them one at a time.
 *
 * So the root is the list. The single-day editor is still here, unchanged in what
 * it does, but reached by tapping the day you want rather than by hunting for it
 * in a picker. `Add a day` opens the same editor with nothing in it.
 *
 * One record per day throughout: `putWeight` overwrites rather than appending, so
 * saving onto an existing day is an edit, and the editor says so.
 */

/**
 * The editor for one day, as a pushed panel.
 *
 * The date stays editable rather than being fixed by the row you arrived
 * through. Logging to the wrong morning is the mistake this whole surface exists
 * to fix, and correcting it should not mean deleting one day and creating
 * another.
