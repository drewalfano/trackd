 * field was never the confusing part; the numbers being unreachable was, and no
 * amount of prose fixes that. A control does. The one sentence kept is the
 * deleted-food case, because that one is not justifying an absence: it states a
 * fact about your library that nothing else on screen carries.
 *
 * All three reasons land here, which is the point rather than an economy. An
 * estimate, a quick add and an entry whose food has since been deleted have
